The primary goal is to promote patient comfort, prevent complications, and facilitate a smooth recovery process. Pain management plays a crucial role in the management of these patients. Adequate pain control is essential to ensure patient comfort and facilitate early mobilization. This may involve the use of analgesic medications, regional anesthesia techniques, or non-pharmacological interventions. Close monitoring of vital signs, pain levels, wound healing, and functional status is essential in detecting any potential complications or changes in the patient's condition. This allows for timely intervention and modification of the treatment plan if necessary. Regular follow-up appointments with orthopaedic surgeons or other healthcare providers involved in the patient's care are also scheduled to assess progress, address any concerns, and ensure continuity of care.")

Validation of the model has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving an impressive AUC of 0.974 (95%CI: 0.959-0.983). However, it is crucial to emphasize that this model was developed solely for research purposes. Therefore, clinical treatment decisions for bone metastases should not be solely reliant on the AI platform. Instead, it is recommended to consider the modelâ€™s predictions as an additional tool to aid in decision-making, complementing the expertise and judgment of healthcare professionals.')
